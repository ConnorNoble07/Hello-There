		<h2>More About me!</h2>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm Connor, but you know that already. I'll tell you some things you might not know: I have autism and I live with my mom.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At BOCES I take Computer and Information Science. I used to do well in school, but haven't done too well after 2020, until recently. We don't need to get into why here, as we have in the past.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have always had a facination with computers, starting from my love of video games. My grandpa got me into games, him having played Mario when it originally released on the NES in 1985. My love of computers is my passion and is what I plan on for my future. As we've discussed, I want to start a company (CTI) to improve the world. SUNY Canton is my place to start. Creating a website for this sort of thing isn't as hard as it sounds, but it is time consuming to get right.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All-in-all, I hope you've enjoyed reading about me a bit. It might not be the most facinating thing in the world, but I appreceate you reading this anyway. Now, I want to ask you an important question.</p>
			<br>
		<h2>Would you go out with me?</h2>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I know you may not have expected this from me, or maybe you did and I was really obvious about it. Either way, I can't deny the way I feel. In the words of REO Speedwagon "What started out as friendship has grown stronger, I only wish I had the strength to let it show, I tell myself that I can't hold out forever, I said there is no reason for my fear." There is so much truth in that song to how I feel. I want to be with you, Sophia.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have two potential ideas for where we can go. Either Little Italy on main street, or we can go to see a movie at the American Theater. I'd even like to do prom with you, if you're up for it.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, I don't want to make you uncomfortable, and don't feel pressured into anything; at the end of the day, it's your choice. But this is something I've contemplated for a long time. I don't want to ruin this friendship. It is the most special and best friendship I've ever had. You understand and listen to me in a way no one ever had before. Even if this doesn't work out, I still want that. I want you to know as well that I will always be for you too, the way you are for me, through my darkest moments. You are the first person to feel like a real friend.</p>
