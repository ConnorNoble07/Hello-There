		<h2>More About me!</h2>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm Connor, but you probably know that already. I'll tell you some things you might not know: I have autism, ADHD, PTSD, and anxiety. I live with my mom and don't talk to my dad.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At BOCES I take Software Development and Buisness Design (Soon to be renamed Computer and Information Science). I used to do well in school, but haven't done too well after 2020, until recently.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have always had a facination with computers, starting from my love of video games. My grandpa got me into games, him having played Marion when it originally released on the NES in 1985. My love of computers is my passion and is what I plan on for my future.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All-in-all, I hope you've enjoyed reading about me a bit. It might not be the most facinating thing in the world, but I appreceate you reading this anyway. Now, I want to ask you an important question.</p>
			<br>
		<h2>Would you go out with me?</h2>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I know we don't talk very often, and you don't know much about me besides what you just read, but I want to see where things could go. Of course, no pressure, just think about it.</p>
		<p>I don't know where we'd go or anything, maybe the movies, or a restaurant. I'd really leave that up to you, unless you'd rather I choose. Either way is fine with me.</p>
